<p>A young and merry man lived a few years ago in Borgarsveit, either in Kimbastaðir or in Sauðá. One winter evening he was walking the road that lies along the mountain; the moon shone bright. When the man had gone a bit further than Kimbastaðir he saw that a woman was walking quite slowly right before him. He began to walk faster, because he wanted to talk to the girl and find out where she was coming from, but he couldn't get closer to her and found that curious. He now began to run and shouted to her to wait for him. She halted and turned around, but didn't reply and then commenced walking again. The man grew angry but the girl didn’t want to answer, and his wish to reach her increased. He runs even faster after the girl. Just north and east of the field in Brennigerði, one farm further than Kimbastaðir, stands a huge rock, quite particular in appearance, called Grásteinn (Grey-stone). The girl headed towards the rock but didn’t move very fast and the man ran as fast has he could. When he reached the rock, it appeared as if a door opened and the girl walked towards it. He saw the he would probably lose the girl now and was unhappy. He was at that moment quite close to the girl, but she was almost inside the rock. The man had a large tip-staff in his hand and hit the girl, the blow hit her hip and she screamed out loud. She then turned around and said angrily: “For this foul deed I will revenge ruthlessly. I will put the spell on you that from this day on you will steal from people whenever you can. In all your waking hours your mind will suffer and your life will be a great burden, and you will become and old man.” The girl then disappeared but her spell came true. Until that day he had never been known to commit any crime but from now on he became a notorious thief. He suffered from neurosis and was extremely unhappy, but became quite old. </p>
