<p>Many years ago, there lived að very skilled man called Tómas in Nautabú in Skagafjörður, and it was well known that he was more gifted than many of his neighbours. Another farmer called Skúli lived in Brekkukoti, not far off, known for his strength.</p>
<p>One day an old woman in the neighbourhood passed away, and was buried by reverend Jón Konráðsson at the churchyard in Mælifell.</p>
<p>Few days later, the reverend dreamed that the old woman came to him and asked for help, for she could not rest peacefully in her grave. Jón woke up from the dream, thought nothing of it, and fell asleep. Again the old woman came to him and asked for help, and threatened that if he would not help her, he would not rest peacefully when his day would come. Jón woke up, sprang to his feet, got dressed and went to the churchyard. There he could se Tómas and Skúli, stand over the old woman’s grave, resurrecting her. When they saw the priest, they panicked, and left. The ghost they left behind, and the reverend was forced to battle it, and as it was very strong, the battle was long and trying for the reverend, who finally managed to get the old woman back in her grave.</p>
<p>It is not known why the friends needed a ghost, but it is likely that they were going to use her to run some small errands for them.</p>
