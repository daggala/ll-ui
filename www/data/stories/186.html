<p>Explanation: A beached whale in pre-industrial Iceland was very valuable and by law, the owner of the land where the whale beached was automatically the owner of the whale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>West of Skagafjörður stands a mountain, quite high; it is called Tindastóll (Chair of peaks), but in the olden days it was called Eilífsfjall (The eternal mountain). The root of the mountain stands by the sea and it separates two districts, the outer Laxárdalur and Reykjaströnd. Earlier, people would travel quite frequently between the two places, one can see by how the districts are positioned, that the shortest road between them was the lowland under the mountain possible. Granted, there were other routes available and still are today, one lies over the moor from Laxárdalur. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, a whale beached in Reykjafjara, north of the foot of the mountain; people from Reykjaströnd gathered together to cut the whale. But when news of the beached whale reached the people of Laxárdalur they also gathered people together, lead by the reverend and the deacon in Hvammur. They wanted to declare ownership of the whale on behalf of the church in Hvammur, and therefore they went to meet the people from Reykjaströnd who were already cutting the whale. The two groups soon started disputing over the ownership of the whale and each believed that the other was wrong and neither wished to yield. In the end, benevolent people reasoned with them and it was decided that the people of Laxárdálur should take an oath, if they were certain that the land was theirs and if they did, the people of Reykjaströnd would retreat. People of Laxárdalur walked towards the whale and took an oath and claimed that the land they stood on was the property of the church in Hvammur. And that was true, the land in their shoes was in deed the property of Hvammur but the ground under the shoes was the property of Reykir in Reykjaströnd because they had cut turf from the landholding of the church in Hvammur, some say from the graveyard, and put into their shoes, earlier that day.</p>
<p>Once the oaths were taken the people of Reykjaströnd gave up the whale and went home, because they believed that the testimony was legitimate, and the people of Laxárdalur took over cutting the whale. A few moments later a landslide came down the mountain, over the men and the whale so all was lost but one boy who had not taken the oath; he got away and gave the news in Laxárdalur. But the landslide did not only cover the men and the whale but took away the road at the foot of the mountain; the landslide is since called Hvalurð or Whalescree (The whale's landslide). People say that before the landslide fell a man dressed in white was seen on the top of the mountain, holding a staff and struck the ground with it, exactly where the landslide came from. </p>
