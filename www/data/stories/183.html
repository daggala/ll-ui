<p>This man named Oddur had, in his younger days, been engaged to be married to an intelligent and promising, albeit poor, woman from a neighbouring farm. His parents and other relatives opposed to this arrangement but remained idle since Oddur hadn't even finished his education. It was said that he had gone to university, and become a reverend. </p>
<p>When he returned, the kinsfolk took action and were so persuasive in discouraging him that upon their advice he married a rich girl, named Ingibjörg, and jilted his fiancé. It was however she herself who formally broke off the engagement and said on that occasion: "I ask you that however I will depart from this world that you allow me to rest in a graveyard." Oddur's response remains unknown. But it was likewise a part of the agreement, that this woman, whose name was Sólveig, should stay in the reverend's service as long as she wished. The reverend and Ingibjörg got married and were content. Bit by bit Sólveig however showed symptoms of madness and was kept under constant watch. But one day the watch broke, the shepherd found her in the smithy at the farmyard; she had slit her throat. He was startled and broke the news to the household. Everybody was alarmed by this incident. At this time, a person that took her own life, could not be buried at a churchyard. The reverend decided, at the instigation of his wife, to empty one of Sólveig's chests of clothes and bury her in it, in her state, just outside the graveyard. </p>
<p>A few years passed, nothing newsworthy took place but the reverend grew afraid of the dark and could hardly go anywhere about alone. Once upon a time, in the autumn, the reverend was traveling around the parish, doing his duty, and came one night to one of his best friends, but it is not said what his name was. The friend pressed the reverend to stay the night as darkness was creeping in. But the reverend couldn't be persuaded and refused any company. The friends disputed for a while but at last, reverend Oddur left. His friend sent one of his workers to follow Oddur and made him promise not to leave him until they'd be at the farmyard. Then they rode off but the reverend urged the worker to turn back home. When they reached the hayfield of Miklabær the worker finally gave in and returned home.</p>
<p>It is now to be told, that in Miklabær, Ingibjörg stayed awake and waited for her husband that night, and a little boy with her. After a little while she believed she heard hoof beat in the farmyard. She asked the boy to go outside and see whether the reverend had returned. The boy went but when he came to the door he became so afraid that he lost all his courage. Still, he opened the door, but felt that the darkness was so ominous that he didn't dare to go outside. He decided to wait a while at the doorstep, or as long as it would have taken him to walk around the farmhouse. Then he returns inside and claimed that nobody had arrived and that he had indeed walked around the farmhouse. The reverend's wife believed him and went to bed. She thought to herself that the reverend would have stayed the night with his friend. But the morning after, when people arose, they found the reverend's horse, with its harness, wandering about the farmyard, but the reverend's whip and mittens lay by the front door.  A search group was immediately formed and they hunted the whole district high and low without success. The last resort was to seek assistance from a sorcerer to find out where the reverend might be and he accepted to do so. But as he did, he felt as if he saw Sólveig aim her weapon at his head and say: "If you mean to seek the reverend, I will put you to death. I expect that the reverend will not rest closer to the graveyard than I do." Then he woke up from the trance and by no means did he want to mention this to anybody and the matter slowly dissolved into apathy. </p>
</p>Many years later, when this story was long forgotten, the farm in Miklabær was taken down and moved, if I remember correctly. In the outer wall of the house, the one that faced the farmyard, a skeleton was found, standing upright. From a gold ring on its hand people were sure it was the remains of reverend Oddur because the ring was distinct and had letters on it. According to beliefs of that age, people explained the incident thus: Sólveig had, in the shape of Oddur's wife, opened the wall for him and buried him there but he would have been under the illusion that it was the front door being opened.</p> 
<p>Oddur's friend, the one who he stayed with the evening before he died, is supposed to have composed this stanza, when he was reminiscing the disappearance of reverend Oddur:</p>

<blockquote>
Grieving I can say,<br/>
hurtful is the spike of death.<br/>
My dear friend reverend Oddur <br/>
has disappeared from Miklibær.	
</blockquote>

</p>Many years later, Sólveig’s bones were found buried just outside the churchyard at Miklibær. The local priest did not want to go against the will of Oddur, and rebury her at the churchyard at Miklibær, so the bones were buried at Glaumbær, not far off. There her headstone can still be found, and on it says „Hér hvílir Sólveig frá Miklabæ“, „Here lies Sólveig from Miklibær“, for her father’s name was long forgotten.</p>
