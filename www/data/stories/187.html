<p>Once upon a time it happened in Hvammur in Laxárdalur, in those days when mass was still held during Christmas night, that a man who stayed home while others went to mass disappeared, and the same happened the next Christmas night, but the third year nobody wished to stay at home except for one who volunteered. When the people had left for church he took a good book and read for a while until he heard someone moving about out in the corridor, he puts out the light and manages to hide himself between the panel and the wall. He hears that the rustle moves closer to the living room and becomes more frightening and the commotion noisier and once it is inside the living room the noise fills every corner and a loud cheering brakes out when they discover that nobody is at home. They turn on the light, put a table to the middle of the room and a tablecloth on top of it and pull out all sorts of fancy utensils and incredible delicacies. At the high point of the party the man suddenly came out from his hiding place and the hidden people were so startled that they jumped out, and headed to the moor straight towards Nykursskál (a hollow south and east of Geitafellshnjúkur). The man follows them but loses them into the rocks. But the man returns home and enjoys the rest of the food on the table. From that day on, nothing sinister ever happened on Christmas night. Hvammur was renamed Kasthvammur (Haste-Hvammur) because of the haste with which the hidden people left the party. </p>
