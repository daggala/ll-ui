<p>There once was a farmer in Tinnársel in Austurdalur in Skagafjörður named Ólafur; he was considered a sorcerer. Once upon a time he was travelling in Svartárdalur in Húnavatnssýsla and he had reached Bergsstaðir in the night. When he passed the graveyard he saw a man wrestling a ghost that had recently been resurrected, but the ghost had subdued the man; Ólafur shouted out to the man: “Bite her breast you damn thing”. Ólafur then continued his journey. It was said that the man had taken his advice and that it worked, but started hating Ólafur, being envious of his knowledge, and rumour has it that he made the ghost go after Ólafur. But Ólafur was prepared and put the ghost into a leg of a horse, put the leg into a compartment of a chest and kept it there for the rest of his life. Just before he died he asked his daughter Guðbjörg to burn the leg when he would pass, and try not to pull the plug from it. </p>
<p>When he was dead Guðbjörg took the leg out of the chest and out of curiosity she pulled the plug and saw when a small fly flew out of it. It immediately took the shape of a woman who asked what she should do. “Go to Nýibær,” Guðbjörg said, “and kill the farmer Guðmundur Nikulásson”. Jón, Guðbjörg’s husband, wanted Guðmundur to leave his farm so he could move there himself.</p>
<p>The ghost went straight away to find Guðmundur, but he managed to defend himself. Next spring he however moved away to Krákugerði because during the winter the ghost had haunted him so badly that he was about to lose his mind. Consequently, Jón and Guðbjörg moved to Nýibær and the ghost stayed with them and their kin ever since and is called either the ghost of Ábær or Nýibær. </p>
<p>People say that the ghost killed Jón because when he was on his deathbed, a girl watched over him and one evening she suddenly felt weak and had a hard time staying awake; she felt as if a red light filled the room and that somebody walked inside. And then she heard a sound like Jón’s throat was rattling and as if somebody walked passed her; she then regained her power and was able to check upon Jón, who was already dead.</p>
<p>The ghost now began to destroy as much she could; she killed various animals and was often seen before anybody came out of Guðbjörg’s and Jóns’s house. </p>
<p>Their daughter, Guðrún, lived in Héraðsdalur. The ghost harassed her and she was sent away and stayed in the farm Vatn with another farmer called Jón. The ghost didn’t bother her there but when she returned home the harassment began again, Guðrún lost her mind and committed a suicide in the end. Jón the farmer said he often saw the ghost when Guðrún stayed with him.</p>
<p>There are many other stories known of her mischievous deeds; she kills both sheep and cattle in Merkigil and surrounding areas; sometimes she is seen climbing the beam in living rooms and hanging there at nights. Once she was seen sitting on top of a dung heap, throwing manure around – Jón and Guðbjörg had a bull in the cow house; once some men were fetching a bull from Miklibær but just before they arrived, a cow mooed terribly in the cow house and fell dead. The reverend there refused the men to take the bull away and blamed the ghost.
<p>Once when Guðmundur had moved away from Nýibær to Krákugerði he was riding to Uppsalamýri; it was dark and all of a sudden it felt as if the horse became paralyzed, Guðmundur fell and broke his foot. When he tried to stand up he saw where the ghost skipped into the marsh and disappeared behind a hill. </p>
<p>When a farmer named Hjálmar lived in Nýibær he once found the ghost about to kill a sheep; he drove her away over the river Tinnaá and she was never able to cross it again because Hjálmar’s words were more powerful than others. </p>
<p>Once upon a time Páll the shepherd of Merkigil fell asleep in the sheep shed but when he was just about to fall asleep the ghost showed up and tried to strangle him but he woke up and she disappeared.
<p>This is how the ghost is described: she is about the same height as a twelve-year-old girl; but sometimes she appears as large as a troll, she wears a rust brown skirt and a sheep-black sweater; sometimes she has been seen wearing a sweater or clothes of hide and a rust brown cap without the tassel. </p>
