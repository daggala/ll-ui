<p>Like other fertile parts of Iceland, the Skagafjörður region attracted many of the island's early settlers. If we can rely on the Book of Settlements, this region had become entirely settled by the first half of the 10th century, like the rest of the country's vegetated lowlands. </p><p>Icelanders associate the 13th century with the Sturlungar clan. During this century, Skagafjörður experienced extreme suffering and horror due to the fighting between clans for power over the island. The Sturlungar, supported by the King of Norway, ruled over most of West Iceland and the eastern part of North Iceland, while the Ásbirningar controlled Skagafjörður. The Haukdælir clan of South Iceland allied themselves with the Ásbirningar against the Sturlungar, but the Oddaverjar clan, who also lived in South Iceland, and the Skaftafell chieftains of East Iceland varied in whom they supported. In the Örlygsstaðir battle of 1238, the Ásbirningar beat the Sturlungar with the help of the Haukdælir. On Húnaflói bay in 1244, the Ásbirningar won yet another battle, but were later overpowered by the Sturlungar at the Haugsnes battle of 1246. Sixteen years afterwards, the Icelanders succumbed to the King of Norway by accepting what came to be called the Old Covenant.</p><p>The map shows farms and other place names, based on written sources pre-dating 1400. These sources were the relevant sagas, especially the Book of Settlements and Saga of Christianity, as well as the Saga of the Sturlungar and 14th-century estate documents (contracts or purchase agreements along with church and farm property records). </p><p>Although the communities covered a larger area and more farms existed than the map indicates, people in the violent Age of the Sturlungar would have been familiar with all of the places and names given here.</p><p>Welcome to the Sturlung Trail!</p>
