<p>East from Valadalur in the district of Skagafjörður stands a high mountain called Valadalshnúkur; in the mountain is a certain hill called Móðarsfell and in the hill is a cave called Móðarshellir; the names derive from the following story. </p>
<p>In Víðimýri lived a reverend; he had a daughter named Sigríður; she was a promising and a bright girl. Every summer she worked in a so-called sel, a place quite far from the farm where the sheep was grazing; a young maid called Margrét stayed with her. </p>
<p>One day around Christmas the reverend was leaving for Glaumbær to give a mass. He left early in the morning. Sigríður and Margrét planned to attend the mass and departed later than the reverend. Soon after the departure a dark fog and heavy snowfall crept in; they got lost and didn't know which way they went.</p>
<p>When they had been walking for a while, Sigríður puts her foot down and states that this will not do any longer and that she wishes to swear an oath and see if the snow won't stop. She swears that she will never have any man unless his name is Móðar.</p>
<p>As soon as she had made her oath she regrets her haste, but the snow stopped and they saw they had gone further than Glaumbær and had to turn around. When they reached the church it was nearly the end of the mass and the congregation was singing the last psalm. In the evening they went home with the reverend. Time passes until it is summer again and they have to start working in the sel. Sigríður was reluctant to do so but had to obey her father's orders. Sigríður and Margrét took turns in taking some things to the farm at the end of each day, and one day when Margrét had gone home, Sigríður was doing the washing in a brook nearby when a tall man walks to her and greets her in friendly manners. Sigríður remained indifferent. "Do you not greet me?" says the stranger, "you will at one point have to speak to me because you have sworn not do have any man unless his name is Móðar, and I am the only one in Iceland to bear that name – and so that you know better who I am, my mother is a troll and lives in a hill in Valadalshnúkur. She bewitched a human from Vatnsdalur to her cave once and I am their offspring; she has taught me witchcraft but he taught me Christian faith and various sports; he died a few years ago. My mother has allured to us nine maidens, but killed them all since she didn't find any of them good enough for me. She conjured the storm that you got lost in on Christmas and with the power of her witchcraft she made you take the oath. Now it is best that we resign ourselves to what has happened."</p>
<p>Sigríður hardly uttered a word and sulked, and when he saw he couldn't soften her he said his goodbyes and asked her to be there the next day because he would come for a visit. The next day, Sigríður was absent-minded and complained that she might be sick; thus Margrét had to take things to the farm again, but Sigríður stayed behind. Soon, Móðar appears and tells her that the day after, his mother will come to visit her. He asks her not to be afraid, even though his mother might strike her as quite large and repulsive; she will ask for skyr and she should give her two half-hundredweight bowls, that should be enough, and even though she will carry her machete, Sigríður should not worry. Móðar then leaves.</p>
<p>The next day, Sigríður was still alone in the sel. The troll arrives; she was both large and mean looking. She greeted Sigríður who greeted her back and stood on the doorstep as Móðar had advised her to do. The troll asks to taste skyr. Sigríður shows her the bowls that she had filled with skyr and put outside and gives her a large ladle to eat with. She gobbles up the skyr until there is only a bit left in one bowl; she stretches and says: "This was a suitable portion."</p>
<p>Then she grabs her machete and points it towards Sigríður and asks: "Are you fit to be my daughter in law?" When she sees that Sigríður doesn't flinch she turns back and says: "You are not even a bit afraid little one!"</p>
<p>Then she walks up a sandbank, but bumps into a large rock, falls and bursts. Móðar had arrived by then and he drags the clump that was his mother into the river. He admits that his witchcraft knowledge may have helped with the death of his mother. He says that he will not return again to the sel but that he will visit the farm next Christmas and ask to stay the night.</p>
<p>The summer passes and winter until Christmas. But on Christmas Eve somebody knocks on the front door of the farm in Víðimýri; people go to the door and find the visitor unusually tall. He asks them to ask the reverend if he could stay that night. One of the workers goes and tells the reverend that a man has arrived and asks to stay the night, but that he is so tall that he will not fit into the house.</p>
<p>The reverend then asks that this man is told to leave but then his daughter steps in and tells her father that is not proper to refuse someone shelter on Christmas Eve. The visitor was then invited to come inside and even though he was indeed quite tall, the reverend took a liking to him; he was dressed nicely, polite in his manners and handsome in appearance. They began to converse and the visitor proved sensible. After a while the reverend decided to offer the man to stay the whole Christmas and he accepted.</p>
<p>Before the visitor departed he shared the information on his background with the reverend and asked for his daughter's hand in marriage. Even though the reverend had another suitor in mind for his daughter he decided to ask Sigríður to settle the matter. Sigríður was positive and it was decided that a wedding should take place the following spring. </p>
<p>In the spring, Móðar and Sigríður got married and the reverend offered Móðar landholding in Skagafjörður but he rather wished to stay in his cave and brought Sigríður there. She was happy living in the cave with him and did not lack anything.</p>
<p>A year later, Móðar came to Víðimýri to ask the reverend to baptize their baby but soon, the baby died; the same happened to the second baby and when the third was born both the baby and Sigríður died. Móðar built his wife a coffin, put the baby next to her and took the coffin to Víðimýri. He then stayed with the reverend for a while, but was overcome with grief and one day he went back to his cave and never returned. The reverend went to the cave to see if he could find Móðar but saw that rocks had been piled in the mouth of the cave and when he managed to clear a path to get inside he found Móðar's body. He took the body and had it moved to Víðimýri where he buried him. Finally he took all valuables from the cave and to his house and nobody has ever lived in that cave since. </p>
