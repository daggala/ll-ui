<p>The farmer Hallur from Geldingarholt was one of Skagafjörður‘s best wrestlers. One summer he traveled south looking for work, and wrestled one of the most famous wrestler of Southern Iceland, and won. The wrestler was mad about the defeat and swore vengeance.</p>
<p>During the same time a farmer lived in Vatnsskarð, known for his magical abilities. One day when he was tending his sheep, he saw a girl dressed in animal hides walking by. He called to her, and asked where she was going. She answered that she was on her way to kill Hallur. The farmer offered her to come home with him, which she accepted. When they arrived at the farm, the farmer locked her in the barn and put a spell on it so she couldn’t get out, for this was no ordinary girl, this was a ghost called Skinnpilsa (The one who wears a hide skirt). The farmer was tired and went to bed after dealing with the ghost, and forbade his family to open the barn. His wife forgot it, and opened the barn to fetch some wool. When the farmer woke and heard of this he gasped:”Oh dear god, now Hallur must be dead!” He took his best horse and rode as fast as he could down the valley, so fast that a short distance from Hallur’s farm, the horse gave up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hallur was walking to his stables and found one of his horses meets him at the door with a broken neck. The farmer got wary, and suspected something evil at work. At that moment the farmer from Vatnsskarð got to him, and together they manage to hold back the ghost, and finally, send her back to the southerner that sent him to kill Hallur.</p>
<p>The ghost Skinnpilsa was so great when she got back south, that nothing could be done to finish her off. In the end however she settled at Neðranes, at Skagi, and was a lot less troublesome. She haunted places where there were no men, but the biggest harm she did was to startle people and bother children. </p>
<p>One day Níels Skálda visited Neðra nes, and as he enters he saw the ghost troubling a group of kids, and drove her off. Skinnpilsa fled, and Níels followed, and their battle was long and fierce. Finally Níels managed to lock her up in a moor. Later he said that the battle nearly killed him, and that the moor could never be disturbed or Skinnpilsa would be up and about once more.</p>
<p>Many years later, when the phone line was being built, a pole for the line was planted in the middle of Skinnpilsa’s moor. After that, it is said that she roams the area, bringing trouble wherever she goes.</p>
