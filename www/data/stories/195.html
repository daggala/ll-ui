<p>There was a man named Jón, called Reykja-Jón. He lived for many years in Reykir in Reykjaströnd in Skagafjörður. The year before he moved to Reykir he had been a freelance worker and during winters he travelled around the country and sold various goods like silk scarfs etc.</p>
<p>Once upon a time Jón was staying at a vicarage in the eastern part of Iceland and in the evening he was showing his silk scarves and one was particularly expensive and beautiful and the reverend’s daughter was eager to buy it and asked Jón to sell it to her if she managed to find a way to pay for it before he left. Jón agreed but in the back of his mind he felt as if her appearance wasn’t all that trustworthy, even though she looked young, not over 25 years old.</p>
<p>But now Jón is told to stay in the living room, and the reverend’s daughter shows him to bed. When Jón has just laid down the girl lies in front of him and puts her arm around his neck and asks if he wouldn’t be so kind to give her the scarf. Jón is furious at the girl for daring to lie next to him, since he is a married man and pushes her out of the bed and to the floor. The girl grew angry in return and promises Jón that she will send him her mother’s bitch from the kitchen and that he can keep the scarf for himself.</p>
<p>Jón was by no means affected by her words and the next day he left and continued his journey. The next spring he moves to Reykir, as already mentioned. Time passes with no news until one evening just before Christmas that Jón is checking up on his sheep in the mountain. All of a sudden a huge cat jumps up his back and latches on to his shoulders. Struggling for a while, Jón manages to get rid of the cat because he was quite a skilled man, but when he returned home people saw that he had obviously had some kind of an accident. He was all torn between the shoulder blades and had bled considerably. He then told his wife everything but assured her that he was capable of defending both of them but it wouldn’t surprise him if the cat would try to spoil their relationship. It was said that the reverend’s daughter had killed her mother’s bitch and turned into a cat. </p>
<p>After this the couple couldn’t get along with each other once they were in bed and a grey cat was frequently seen jumping into their bed. It went so far that in the end they had to divorce. And until this day, the cat been around and considered the most obnoxious of visitors in Jón’s family – and ruined many a marriages. </p>
