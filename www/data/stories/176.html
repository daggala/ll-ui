<p>In 1246, the Sturlung leader Þórður the Cackler gathered 600 troops in the Eyjafjörður area and headed for Skagafjörður, where they camped by Skeljungshöfði the night before the battle. Numbering 700 men, the Ásbirning troops spent the night at Víðimýri and were still gathering at Haugsnes the following morning when the Sturlungs surprised them with a side attack. For a long time, the battle remained even. Suddenly, however, some of the Ásbirnings started to flee. The Sturlungs had an agent among the Ásbirnings, and when he pretended to flee, many others followed him, leaving the Ásbirning side nearly helpless. The Ásbirning leader, Brandur Kolbeinsson, was killed, with his side losing 60 men in all and the Sturlungs 40 men. In commemoration, a cross was erected there and the site was named Roðugrund, with the first four letters meaning "rood", or an image of the Crucifixion. </p>
