<p>In the northern part of the hayfield of the farm Keta in Skagi stands a high and steep rocky cliff; it is called Grímsborg. Hidden people have usually inhabited the cliff and as a rule the person in charge was called Grímur. According to old people, who have recently passed away, four hidden people lived there in their days, two men and two women. They would normally go two together to attend the mass in Keta, but two would stay at home. 
<p>Once upon a time weather conditions had made living in Skagi hard and people had started to die from hunger. One day, around springtime the farmer in Keta walked passed the cliff; and composed this poem:</p>
<blockquote>
A whale drift I need<br/>
neighbour Borgar Grímur<br/>
I have many mouths to feed<br/>
They'll not last til summer
</blockquote>
<p>From the cliff he heard the reply:</p>
<blockquote>
A whale will drift to shore<br/>
Right by the sands of Keta<br/>
Bound by the ropes of death<br/>
To save those who are in need.
</blockquote>
