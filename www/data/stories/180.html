<p>The only marine combat occurred on 25 June 1244. The two leaders were Kolbeinn the Young, an Ásbirning, and Þórður the Cackler, a Sturlung. Whereas Þórður had only 15 ships and 210 men, Kolbeinn the Young had 20 ships and 470 men. While sailing from the Strandir area farther west, Þórður encountered Kolbeinn's ships on Húnaflói bay. Kolbeinn had embarked from Selvík, on the Skagi peninsula, with the intention of capturing Þórður. The battle started immediately, using rocks and burning torches as the main weapons. In spite of the difference in manpower, Þórður’s men fended off Kolbeinn for a considerable time, and in the end managed to escape without Kolbeinn being able to catch them. </p>
