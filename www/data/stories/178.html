<p>Generally known as Hólar in Hjaltadalur valley, this was long a centre of North Iceland culture and became the seat of the bishop of the North in 1106. One of the most famous bishops at Hólar was called Guðmundur the Good. Serving in the 13th century, he was a humble person who was popular among commoners, though he often had to flee Hólar because of disagreements with Ásbirning leaders and other powerful Icelanders. In 1208, his disagreements with the chieftain Kolbeinn Tumason climaxed in a formidable rock fight down the valley from Hólar, at Víðines. While Guðmundur lost only 3 men, Kolbeinn and 9 of his men were killed. The cathedral, which is the oldest stone-built church in Iceland (1753-63), was constructed using red sandstone taken from nearby Hólabyrða mountain.   </p>
