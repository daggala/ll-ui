<p>The site for the Skagafjörður regional þing, or political assemblies from 930 to 1262, was on the east side of the Hegranes area. Overall assemblies were also held here for the whole of North Iceland, and remains from these times are still visible in the landscape. The best-known accounts of these ancient assemblies are found in some of the sagas, not least when Grettir the Strong came from his hideout on the isle of Drangey out in the fjord and wrestled with others attending the assembly. Because he had been outlawed, he came to the assembly in disguise and received a promise that he would not be harmed, so that he was allowed to leave again in peace, despite having since been recognised. Another event we know of was in 1305, when the people of Skagafjörður ganged up on an emissary of the Norwegian king to protest against the new taxes he was proclaiming. </p>
