<p>Grettir Ásmundarson is one of Iceland’s most notorious outlaws, having a whole saga, Grettissaga, dedicated to him alone. He was supposedly alive in the 11th century. Grettir was known throughout Iceland as one of the strongest men that lived (this is a common lore today, as big rocks, just about impossible to lift, are named Grettistak after him. A great feat, seeming impossible, is also called Grettistak). He travelled much in Iceland and to other countries, and challenged most that he met, men, beasts or ghosts, to wrestle with him. He had no control over his temper, and caused the death of many men. For this he became an outlaw, which in those days in Iceland meant, that he could be killed on sight.</p>
<p>Grettir lived for a few years in Drangey Island, an island, very steep, in Skagafjörður. The island was perfect for him, as it provided enough food, through birds and sheep that some farmers kept in the island, as well as firewood. Though no trees grew there, the sea carries driftwood to the island.</p>
<p>When Grettir was staying in Drangey there was Hegranesþing, a meeting of all the farmers of the area, held in Hegranes. Grettir went to shore, borrowed clothes and a great hood, and went to the þing (meeting), introducing himself as Gestur.</p>
<p>When he got there men came up to him and encouraged him to take part in the wrestling, as he was large and strongly built. Grettir said that he would gladly take part, but he would need immunity (that he could not be killed). The men take him to the goðorðsmaður, the one in charge of the þing, who granted him the immunity. Grettir then took of his hood, and revealed himself to the crowd. There was a great commotion, as people recognised Grettir, and some wanted to kill him, even though he had immunity, but the goðorðsmaður forbade it, he had given his word.</p>
<p>On the þing there were two brothers, both named Þórður. They were the strongest men from Skagafjörður, and the greatest wrestlers. It was decided that one of the brothers would wrestle Grettir, who agreed. The brother chosen for the fight attacked directly, and ran at his opponent. Grettir received him by taking his belt and throwing Þórður behind him.</p>
<p>It was then decided that Grettir should wrestle both brothers at once. The brothers attacked, and a great and even fight commenced. All of them managed to get some scrapes and bruises, and the fight was declared a draw between the brothers and Grettir. The fight was a hit among the attendance of the þing, and was considered the greatest fun.</p>
