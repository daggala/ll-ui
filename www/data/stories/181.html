<p>In the 13th century, this was one of the chief farms of the locally powerful Ásbirning clan. Their leader Kolbeinn Tumason lived here around 1200. Until Guðmundur the Good became bishop at Hólar in 1203, he served as priest of the church where Kolbeinn lived at Víðimýri. The arguments between these two on Icelandic politics continued until the death of Kolbeinn in the Víðines battle of 1208. Kolbeinn had been one of the country's best poets, and one of his hymns is still popular today. The turf church at Víðimýri, which was built in 1834, is one of Iceland's prettiest and is now protected under the auspices of the National Museum. </p>
