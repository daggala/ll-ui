<p>Within the valleys of Skagafjörður lies a fishing lake called Úlfsvatn, the lake of Úlfur, and this is the story of how that name came about. 
Once upon a time, a rich farmer lived in Mælifellsá; he had a son named Guðmundur, a promising boy, strong and a good wrestler. He often participated in rounding up the sheep in the fall and was often the leader. Once upon a time Guðmundur went with other men to search for sheep. They group split up and Guðmundur was alone with a young boy. When they came to lake Úlfsvatn they saw two lambs and started chasing them. The lake was frozen and they saw that a man was ice fishing in the middle of it. Guðmundur and the boy are close to the lake when the fisherman stands up, grabs an axe, and slides towards them. When the boy sees that, he flees but Guðmundur waits for the man. When the stranger reaches Guðmundur he tries to cut him but Guðmundur moves aside and the man misses. He drops the axe; Guðmundur grabs it and slides away from the man. They go on about like that for a while until Guðmundur seized the right opportunity, turned around and killed the fisherman with his axe. Simultaneously, the man shouted out the names Brandur, Þorgils and Ólafur. Guðmundur returned to his group and told them what happened. They took to the lake but the dead man was gone but he had been taken away and they could see the trace of blood lie away from the lake. </p>
<p>Guðmundur went home but stopped rounding up the sheep, afraid that outlaws would ambush him. Once, late in the summer, it happened that the shepherd in Mælifellsá gets sick and nobody can round up the sheep but Guðmundur himself. He goes but doesn’t find any sheep; he head to the mountains but still doesn’t find them. A thick fog creeps in so he loses his trace and continues for a while until he finds a group of sheep and a man standing next to it. The outlaw immediately attacks Guðmundur and they wrestle for a while until the outlaw falls down. The outlaw asks Guðmundur to show him mercy and promises to pay him well. Guðmundur asks who he is and where he lives. The outlaw said that his name was Ólafur and the man who had been killed on the lake was his brother, his name was Úlfur. “We are six brothers and I am the smallest and youngest. Our father lives here close by and he lured you here to revenge for his son’s killing; he has dug a grave in his yard that he intends for you. We have one sister, her name is Sigríður and she might be willing to lend you a hand. My brother Brandur is here not far away from us and if you try to kill him and spare his life, like you spared mine, Sigríður would help you out if she can.”</p>
<p>Guðmundur then lets Ólafur stand up and continues until he finds Brandur; they wrestle until Brandur falls down and Guðmundur holds him. Brandur asks him to spare his life and promises to help him, just as Ólafur had predicted. Guðmundur lets him stand up and walks to the farm; he meets Sigríður and gives her regards from her brothers and tells her that they had asked her to help out the man who saved their lives. Sigríður takes him to the loft in the cow house and gives him wine, which cheers him up. She tells him where her father had dug his grave and explains how he can pretend to flee from her father but when he reaches the grave, jump over it and see if her father doesn’t fall into it instead; but she asks him not to kill him. She tells him that soon her father will wake up and know that he is here; he shall walk towards the house and knock on the door. Guðmundur does what she asks him and her father gets out of bed when he hears the knocking and knows that Guðmundur has finally arrived and now he will certainly have to show his masculinity. He runs out – there are no polite greetings – and attacks Guðmundur. Guðmundur realizes that the man is twice as strong as he is so he doesn’t attack back, only tries to defend himself.  The man slowly moves Guðmundur towards the grave and Guðmundur lets him – but once there, Guðmundur jumps and pushes the man into the grave, headfirst. </p>
<p>At the same moment, Sigríður and the two brothers arrive and ask him to spare their father’s life; he accepts if they promise that he will not be harmed again. The man promises and is pulled out of the grave. He is thankful and invites Guðmundur inside but tells him that he doesn’t know how his elder sons will react when they come home. Guðmundur is given food and a place to sleep in. The elder brothers come home and ask if Guðmundur has fallen into the grave. Their father explained what happened, they get furious and want to break down the door to Guðmundur’s room but their father walks in front of the door and tells them that they will have to defeat him first if they wish to break the truce. They calmed down and went to bed. </p>
<p>The next morning they saw Guðmundur but their father forbade them to harm him. Guðmundur stayed there this winter because the mountain was impassable; he liked Sigríður because she was beautiful and as strong as all her brothers; they liked each other. In the springtime Guðmundur wished to return to his home and Sigríður wanted to go with him, as she was pregnant. Her father did not discourage them so Guðmundur takes her to Mælifellsá. Everybody welcomed him with relief and felt as if he had returned from death. Guðmundur lived a long time in Mælifellsá, got married to Sigríður who was considered an outstanding woman. Her brothers moved one by one to the area because they found life in their farm quite sad without her and their father when he had passed away. Some of them became farmers in Skagafjörður and were all considered great men. </p>
