<p>There was a man called Guðmundur; he lived in Silfrúnarstaðir in Skagafjörður.  He was rich in livestock, well respected and admired. He was married but had no children.
<p>It thus happened in Silfrúnarstaðir one Christmas Eve that the shepherd did not return that evening. The sheep shed stood at the foot of the mountain, where it still stands, and the shepherd watched the sheep during the day and walked back to the farmhouse in the evening. A search was made for the shepherd but he was nowhere to be found. Next spring, Guðmdundur hired another shepherd called Grímur. He was a big and strong man and by no means a sensitive person. The farmer asks him though to be careful and on Christmas Eve he asks him to put the sheep in to the shed early and return home in daylight. But Grímur does not return that evening; he was searched for the day after but was nowhere to be found. This was considered highly remarkable and people speculated about the fate of the shepherds. Guðmundur was immensely sad about these events and from that day on he couldn't find anyone who wanted to be his shepherd. </p>
<p>In those days a poor widow lived in Sjávarborg. She had many children; her eldest son, Sigurður, was fourteen years old. Guðmundur asked for this boy to become his shepherd and offered his mother a fair amount of money if she would lend him her son. Sigurður was eager to accept and wished to improve his mother's status but she opposed to this arrangement. But in the end, Sigurður took the job and went with Guðmundur. He tended the sheep that summer and did well. The farmer gave him as a present a sheep and an ewe with a lamb, which the boy was thankful for. Guðmundur loved Sigurður dearly and on Christmas Eve he asked Sigurður to be careful and come home before nightfall. Sigurður watched the sheep the whole day and gathered it to the shed at the end of the day. But then he hears heavy footsteps coming from the mountain and sees a troll-woman, quite appalling and hideous. "Hello my dear Sigurður", she says, "now I'm going to put you in my bag tonight." "I wouldn't do that," says Sigurður, "I'm so small and skinny and not a good catch, but here I have a sheep and a lamb that I can give you for dinner." Then he gives her the sheep and the lamb, she puts them both on her shoulders and hikes up the mountain again. Sigurður returns home that evening and Guðmundur welcomes him with relief and asks if he had seen anything unusual. Sigurður refused and said that nothing had happened to him. Hearing this, Guðmundur was extremely glad that he seemed to be rid of this distress. Around the New Year, Guðmundur goes to the sheep shed to examine his sheep and notices that the sheep and lamb that he had given Sigurður were missing. He asks why. Sigurður claimed that the fox had attacked the lamb and torn it apart but that the sheep had simply died, and said that he had not been very lucky with the present Guðmundur had given him. The farmer then gives him another ewe and two more sheep and asks him to stay with him another year. Sigurður accepts; the winter passes and the summer and then winter until next Christmas. The farmer asks Sigurður again to be very careful and told him that he loved him as his own son. Sigurður assured him that there was nothing to be afraid of and that he should not worry.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, Sigurður is gathering the sheep into the shed when the troll-woman appears and tells him that it cannot be delayed any longer to have him for dinner.  Sigurður replies: "I am ready if you like but as you can see there is not much meat on me compared to one sheep, I will now give you for Christmas two sheep and two wether; are you not happy with that?" "Let me see," said the troll-woman. Sigurður put forward the sheep and she hooked the horns together and went up the slope. Sigurður came home that evening and said he hadn't seen anything unusual. The farmer was so fond of Sigurður that the next summer he gave him four sheep and Sigurður stayed his shepherd.</p>
<p>The next Christmas Eve, Sigurður gathers the sheep and once again the troll-woman appears and wishes to take him; he offers her the four sheep he had, she accepted and put them on her back. Then she seizes Sigurður, puts him under her arm and runs up the mountain and to her cave. She puts down her burden and orders Sigurður to cut the sheep and shear the wool. When he was done he asks what to do next; she gives him an axe and tells him to whet it until it cuts easily because she plans to cut of his head with it. Sigurður does what she asks and hands her the axe; she orders him then to clear his neck, which he does without fumbling. The troll-woman then puts the axe away and tells him that she has no intentions to take his life. "You will live a long life," she said, "and be a fortunate man because I arranged for you to become a shepherd in Silfrúnarstaðir, so that I could meet you. I will now tell you what path you should take, that leads to your fortune. Next spring you should leave the farmer and move to Ás in Hjaltadalur; a good carpenter lives there and you should learn carpentry; once you have learned enough you should take goods and trinkets to Miklabær in Ólsandshlíð. The reverend there has three daughters, the youngest, Margrét, is the most promising woman in all of Iceland. The elder daughters enjoy trinkets and finery and will want everything that Margrét does not like.  Then you shall ask her, when you leave, to show you to the door, and once there, you shall ask her to show you to the foot of the field; she will do so and you shall give her these three items I give you now: a scarf, a belt and a ring, and in return you will get her love. But once you have a dream about me, you shall come again here to my cave, and you will find me dead; you should make me a mound as was customary in the older days and take with you from the cave everything that is of any value." Next she let Sigurður go and he returned home. The farmer was by then quite sad and worried and embraced Sigurður and asked whether he had honestly not seen anything unusual.  Sigurður declined and said that he would guarantee that no harm would be done to any of his shepherds ever again. </p>
<p>In the springtime Sigurður left the farm for Ás in Hjaltadalur and became a carpentry apprentice. He was a good student and in two years time had become a skilled carpenter. He kept his good friendship with Guðmundur and visited him frequently. One day he makes his way to Hofsós, where he could buy some trinkets and rare objects, and heads to Miklabær. He offers his goods some beautiful scarfs for sale and. When the elder sisters hear this, they ask him not to show the things to anyone but them and allow them to choose first. Sigurður promises to do so and shows them his goods; they bought many things but Margrét took a look and did not want any of it. When he was leaving he asked Margrét to show him to the door; she does; but when he is at the doorstep he asks her to show him to the foot of the field, and she replies that she does not know what he meant by this, an unmarried man asking her to do so, it was quite rude. Sigurður pursues the matter and finally she agrees to go with him. Sigurður then gives her the objects and puts the ring on her finger. "I would gladly not have accepted your items," Margrét said, "and I can feel that they are designed in a way that makes it impossible for me to return them, and so be it." They went their separate ways and Sigurður returned to Ás.</p>
<p>The objects Sigurður gave to Margrét had the effect that she felt she could not love any man but Sigurður and that she could not live without him. Eventually she shared her feelings with her father who did everything in his power to change her mind on this foolish idea and said that nothing would ever become of this while he lived. Margrét became silent and neither ate nor slept; her father realised that this would not do and headed to Ás in Hjaltadalur and hired Sigurður to be his carpenter. Sigurður stayed there for a while and soon he and Margrét promised each other faith forever, and this was done with her father's consent. Soon afterwards, Sigurður dreamt the troll-woman and was certain that she would now be dead. He asks the reverend to ride with him to Silfrúnarstaðir and stay with Guðmundur. When Guðmundur heard, that Sigurður was engaged to the reverend's daughter he announced, what he had been contemplating for a while, that he wanted to bequeath all his possessions to Sigurður that following spring. Sigurður thanked him dearly and the reverend rejoiced over his daughter's fortune. The next day, Sigurður asked Guðmundur and the reverend to walk with him to the mountain; they arrive at the mouth of a cave and he tells them not to be afraid of entering the cave. They then saw where the troll-woman lay dead on the floor and, rather hideous. Sigurður recounted the whole story and asked them to help him to put the troll-woman in her place. They made a mound from the rocks in front of the cave and then they went further into the cave and found all sorts of items, so much that ten horses were needed to carry everything back to Silfrúnarstaðir. He was generally well respected and a fortunate man to his last day.</p>
<p>On the road along Norðurá, it is said that one can see both the mouth of the cave and the mound in front.</p>
