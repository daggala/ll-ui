<p>In Staðarfjöll in Skagafjörður there used to be a huge cave. Nowadays the cave is hardly visible due to rocks that have fallen down the mountain and into the cave's mouth. But in the olden days, eighteen outlaws lived in the cave. These outlaws captured a girl from the closest inhabited area and made her serve them. Once, on a Sunday, the girl seized a rare opportunity that presented itself and ran away but the outlaws soon realized it and ran after her. The girl ran to Reynistaður where a number of people attended the Sunday mass. By then, the outlaws were so close to the girl that when she was by the bell gate, they had reached the slope by the Cloister. So she started tolling the bells as strongly as she could so the people started hurrying out of the church. The girl explained her situation and asked men to show their vigour and kill the bandits. The men agreed, took their horses and went after the outlaws, who had turned around to flee once they saw the crowd. Seventeen of the outlaws were captured but once got away. The next day a shepherd found the one that got away, asleep, and killed him with a rock. The shepherd was an unfortunate person the rest of his life. The seventeen outlaws were hanged in the sheep shed in Reynistaður; it is since called Skálkhús, house of rascals. Since these events took place the shed has been haunted. The bodies were buried in Dysjagil and not long ago human bones were found in that exact place.</p>
