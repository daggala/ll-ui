<p>Hálfdán the reverend at Fell in Sléttuhlíð studied at Svartiskóli, one of the most renowned magical schools in Europe. People said that he knew great magic, and had made many deals with the devil, always managing to get the better end of the bargain. </p>
<p>One day, he promised the devil that he would get his congregation if he would fertilize his fields. The devil found this to be a great bargain, and started working directly. When he finished and went to Hálfdán to claim his rewards, the reverend gave him a Skyrsá (an old bowl for skyr), and told the devil that this was his congregation. The devil got mad, and brought all the fertilizer, which in those days, was just animal shit, and piled it up in front of the church door. When Hálfdán saw this, he ordered the devil to carry all the fertilizer back to the fields, and to clean the doorstep properly, the devil had to lick all the remains that the of the fertilizer off. Because of a special arrangement Hálfdán and the devil had, the devil was forced to obey, and the morning after all the fertilizer was gone, but there were tongue marks on the doorstep of the church, and still are today. </p>
