<p>Holt in the name Geldingaholt means "hill" and refers to the low hill where the farmstead is located. The stretch of river running on the east side of the hill, Holtskvísl, is also named after it. In the Middle Ages, Geldingaholt was the site of a manor and also of a church dedicated to the apostle Peter, but church services ceased in 1765. In 1252, Þórður the Cackler lived here, until being summoned to meet the Norwegian king and appointing Oddur Þórarinsson to run the farm. In January 1255, however, Oddur was attacked by both the man who had led the burning of Flugumýri farm in 1253, Eyjólfur the Violent, and Hrafn Oddsson. Oddur is famous for his heroic defence before dying.</p>
