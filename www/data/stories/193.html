<p>In the olden days, two trolls lived in Hegranes; a man (karl) and a woman (kerling). Before this took place, they had not been known by any other stories. It happened one day the their cow was in heat; but wether it was because they didn’t have any other cattle, or because they trusted themselves best, they lead the cow themselves away so the cow would not lose her time. The man lead the cow but the woman walked behind them, as was the custom. They took the cow down Hegraness and into the fjord a good distance. </p>
<p>When they still hadn’t reached the middle of the fjord, they saw that day was breaking in east. But because daylight means immediate death to night-trolls, it did exactly that. The trolls turned into stone and became two separate pillars that still today are called Karl and Kerling; but the cow became the island itself, Drangey. </p>
