<p>Miklabæjar Sólveig is one of the most famous ghosts in Skagafjörður. After her true love, reverend Oddur, broke their engagement to marry a richer women, she slowly went mad, and finally killed herself. She returned to haunt the Oddur, and finally killed him, locking him inside the wall of his own home.</p>
<p>Sólveig lived just about a man‘s life before her story was written, so many details are known about her. And when bones of a young woman were found buried just outside the churchyard in Miklibær, just as described in the story, people were positive that there lay Miklabæjar Sólveig. This was supported by the reason for the finding of the bones – many people had dreamt Sólveig, telling them where to find her. </p>
<p>On 11 June 1937, Miklabæjar Sólveig finally got a proper burial in the churchyard of Glaumbær. People said that the reverend of Miklibær did not want to go against the wishes of reverend Oddur, her ex-fiancé, who did not want to bury her at Miklibær, so she was buried in the churchyard by Glaumbær instead. There she still rests. Her father’s name was never known, she is only identified by her fiancé’s farm, where she lived and worked. On the headstone of her grave it says „Hér hvílir Sólveig frá Miklabæ“, „Here rests Sólveig from Miklibær“, as her father’s name was never knowned. </p>
