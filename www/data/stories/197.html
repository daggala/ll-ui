<p>The spring of 1864, the farmer Sigurður Jónsson moved from Reynir in Hegranes in Skagafjörður to the farm Garður in the same district. Sigurður was a good carpenter and did some carpentry when he had time. In the springtime, soon after he arrived in Garður, he was doing some handiwork or other in his shed. Strangely enough, he starts to mislay or lose some of the tools he was using. He starts to look for them, and finds some of it again, but then it is as if he loses something else instead. He also starts to feel like he is making more mistakes than he is used to and doesn’t know what could be the cause. He doesn’t curse, even though he is forced to quit, but walks silently back to his house. </p>
<p>The next night he has a dream about a woman that comes to him and a little boy holds her hand. She speaks: “Thank you for not cursing my boy yesterday when he was taking tools out of your shed. He is quite a naughty boy and gives my great troubles wherever I take him, and he takes all small things he can reach to play with.” Then the woman disappears but the next morning Sigurður remembers his dream and tell his people all about it.</p>
<p>Time passes until the eighteenth week of summer; it suddenly started snowing. The weather had been fine that morning and therefore all cows were out in the field. In the Hegranes district, the landscape is thus: many cliff walls and rocks with grassy hollows or swamps in between. In some places, small lakes have formed in these hollows. The landscape is therefore quite strange but it is also hilly and gives nice shelters, but that makes it difficult to find sheep and cattle in dark weathers. On the aforementioned snowy day some of the cows couldn’t be found, no matter how hard they were searched for. </p>
<p>Sigurður searched for his cows for a long while but they were nowhere to be found; he thought to himself that they might have gone to their former resident in Reynir. But he was forced to stop his search before it got dark even though he was not happy about that, knowing his cows were outside in this snow. In the night he dreamt that the same woman as before comes to him and the naughty boy with her. She spoke: “You need not worry about your cows Sigurður, they are perfectly fine and you will find them tomorrow morning.” Then she left. Early next day Sigurður went out to search for his cows. He finds them just south of the field, by the so-called Ás-tagl. They walk towards him, looking fine and well, completely dry as if they had been inside the whole night. The weather seemed to have had no affect on them at all, not even the milk was less than normally but on all the other farms in Hegranes, where the cows had been outside in the storm, the milk became less and some of the cows were in a bad state, some became infertile and others lost their calves. </p>
