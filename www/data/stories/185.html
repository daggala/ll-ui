<p>In those days, when Loftur the Sorcerer was a student in Hólar it was a universal knowledge that a certain sorcerer was buried in the graveyard of Hólar, and had taken the sorcery book called Gráskinna/Greycover, with him to his grave, and that it was the most important sorcery book ever known. Loftur was determined to obtain this book and asked one of his schoolmates to help him. They went one night to resurrect those who rested in the churchyard and see if the one who had Greycover with him wouldn't appear, and if he succeeded, he would call his mate who should ring the church bell so the ghost would return to his grave as soon as Loftur had obtained the book. Rumour has it, that Loftur had pawned his soul before this happened. Loftur resurrected the whole churchyard, as planned, but the one who possessed Greycover did not show himself. The next night the mates repeated the ceremony but with same results. Loftur realised that this would not do and one evening he renewed his pawn inside the school building; many students believed that his footprints, that he left at that point, could ever since be seen in the floor. The footprints were ankle-deep and charred. Some students even believed this after the middle of the 18th century and believed they had seen the footprints. After this pawn four other schoolmates joined Loftur: The brothers Einar and Ari the sorcerer, sons of reverend Jón from Skinnastaðir, and a certain Jóhann Kristjánsson but the name of the fourth boy is unknown. The brothers proposed to give a mass in the church but have everything reversed because Greycover had been buried with the bishop Gottskálk Gottskálsson under the chancel and there was no hope that he would be resurrected outside. This mass should be finished before dawn. Loftur was supposed to stand in the pulpit and Einar in front of the altar but Ari should lead the singing. He was a good singer, and so was his brother. Jóhann and the other boy should stay in the belfry and ring the bell as soon as Loftur had obtained the book from the bishop, so that he would not have time to harm them. The students took action as soon as everybody was in bed and Loftur began his chanting. When a third of the night remained, three bursts of dirt came from the floor and then an arm dressed in red, with a ring on the hand appeared. This hand held on to a spine of a book but the cover turned upwards so the book was almost open in half. Loftur jumped from the pulpit to grab hold of the book but Jóhann and the other rang the bell too soon and Loftur only obtained three pages of the book before the hand went down with the book. Loftur was so startled when he heard the bell that he fell down and said: "Now my soul has been taken away." The brothers attended to Loftur and brought him out of the church. When they returned home, people were about and dressed because they had heard the church bell. Loftur was put into the schoolhouse and became weaker by the minute. When Bishop Steinn received the news he grew angry but did not press any charges. He ordered them to bury the three pages from Greycover under the altar or wherever the hand had come up, and so was done, but Loftur was indisposed from that day. He said that he would be dead within the year and it would not end well. Once he stopped by the women in the kitchen, the fire was burning. Loftur grinned and told them that the fire burned well but that it would burn even better around him in the winter. It was now decided to move Loftur to another farm, Staðarstaður, where reverend Halldór Brynjólfsson lived, who later became the bishop of Hólar. It was believed that he was very successful in his prayers. It is not known who instigated the move but it was probably Steinn bishop of Hólar. When Loftur came to Staðarstaður, Halldór made sure that he was carefully looked after; a sturdy young man accompanied him everywhere he went. One day, when the reverend was away, Loftur mentioned to his escort that it would be fun to go to the sea since the weather was mild. The escort gave in to this idea and couldn't imagine that it would harm him. But once they had rowed a bit from the shore, Loftur jumped overboard, when he least expected, and did not resurface. This was about one year after Loftur had pawned his soul to the Devil in the school at Hólar. </p>
