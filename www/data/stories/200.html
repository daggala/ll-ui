<p>A man was named Þórður. He lived in Þrastarstaðir in Höfðaströnd in Skagafjörður. He was considered quite a peculiar man. Once, during winter, he left his farm to go to the next village, Hofsós, for trading. It snowed heavily so it was difficult to find one’s way. He was carrying a bag of goods and decides to walk into the swamp because he knew that there he wouldn’t be far from Hofsós. After a short while he gets lost, but continues into the evening. Then he feels like he sees a camp, so large that it was hardly believable. He walks towards it and sees lights through the windows. He looks into one of them and sees people and hears music and sees people dancing. He walks to one of the doors and knocks on it. A man appears in the door wearing an overcoat and asks what he wants. Þórður explains that he had got lost and asked for shelter if that was possible. The man gave his consent; “follow me with your bag of goods. I will trade with you tomorrow and you will not find that any worse than in Hofsós.” Þórður could hardly believe what was happening and felt as if this was all a dream. The man in the coat led him to a living room, even though he wasn’t dressed well enough for that. Many people were in there, a woman, children and workers. Everybody was dressed in fine clothes and singing and partying. The man whispered to his wife, loud enough for Þórður to hear: “There is a man here, tired and lost, he needs some refreshments. Give him something good my dear.” She felt sorry for the poor man and brought a bottle and two glasses and pours wine into them, drinks one herself and gives the other to Þórður. He drinks. He had never in his life tasted as delicious wine. This was indeed a great feast and even though Þórður found his adventure a bit odd, he enjoyed himself. He receives many drinks and slept soundly afterwards. The next morning he also receives food and drink, even more delicious than the day before. The householder then takes him outside and asks to trade with him. They walk into a store, all sorts of merchandise was sold there. Þórður offered the man the goods he had brought. The man, who was indeed a merchant, values everything in Þórður’s possession twice as high as the merchant in Hofsós normally did. Þórður could now choose for himself wheat and linen and various other goods he required. Everything he took was half price compared to what he was used to. </p>
<p>When he was finished, the man gave Þórður a scarf for his wife and bread for his children. The man said that this was done in gratitude for saving his son’s life once upon a time. Þórður thought the man was wrong. The man was certain and said: “You were once close to Þórðarhöfði with other young men. You were waiting for favourable wind since you were heading to Drangey. The men started throwing stones to a cliff, the sun was shining warmly. My son had taken a nap under the cliff; he was tired after staying awake the whole night. You told the men to stop throwing the stones; it was a needless game, you said. They did stop but made fun of you and said you had always been a peculiar man. But if you hadn’t stopped them, they would have killed my son.” Þórður now got ready to leave for home. The weather was much better; it was bright. Þórður took his leave and the merchant walks him down to the road and then returns home. On his way, Þórður looks in the direction of Hofsós but all he saw was Þórðarhöfði. He was surprised at this sight but continued home, met his wife, and told her everything, showed her the goods and gave her the scarf. She rejoiced him and expressed her gratitude. Many people saw the goods that Þórður had bought and such things had never been seen in Iceland or even in other countries. Þórður never saw the merchant again, or any of his people. But the goods he kept with him his whole life.</p>
