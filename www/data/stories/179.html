<p>In earlier times, people called the farm simply Staður, perhaps adding that it was in the Reynines area. From the time of settlement, this was always the farm of a chieftain. The explorer couple Þorfinnur and Guðríður, who discovered what they called Vínland in North America, lived at this farm early in the 10th century, after returning to Iceland. During the 13th century, Reynistaður was one of the principal Ásbirning manors. Guðmundur the Good served as priest here in 1198, then moved to Víðimýri, where Kolbeinn Tumason lived. Kolbeinn passed on the farm of Reynistaður to his son, Brandur, who was killed at Haugsnes in 1246. In 1259, Gissur Þorvaldsson bought the farm, which remained his residence after he was made an earl. Gissur gave the farm to a convent before he died in 1268. The convent was finally established in 1295 but was discontinued in 1552 due to the Reformation, although the nuns were allowed to live here until they died. Earl Gissur is said to be buried under the church floor. </p>
