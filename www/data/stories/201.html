<p>One day in Rif, a town in West Iceland, under Snæfellsjökull glacier, that some sailors ran out of tobacco. They were really unhappy, as every merchant in the area was sold out, and the nearest town to have it was Hofsós, in the north of Iceland.</p>
<p>To save themselves the trip, the sailors roused a ghost to go for them to get the tobacco. The only thing that the ghost needed with him was some food on his way, as he had not been buried when he died, he still needed nourishment.</p>
<p>Some days later, a man was travelling over Fróðárheiði. He saw another man sitting ther, gnawing on a piece of lamb, surrounded by tobacco. He asks for some tobacco from this stranger, who ignors him, and walks away with the tobacco, rounding it up and making it move forward like it was a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>It was said that this winter, not a single person in Rif was out of tobacco.</p>
