<p>Grettir Ásmundarson is one of Iceland’s most notorious outlaws, having a whole saga, Grettissaga, dedicated to him alone. He was supposedly alive in the 11th century. Grettir was known throughout Iceland as one of the strongest men that lived (this is a common lore today, as big rocks, just about impossible to lift, are named Grettistak after him. A great feat, seeming impossible, is also called Grettistak). He travelled much in Iceland and to other countries, and challenged most that he met, men, beasts or ghosts, to wrestle with him. He had no control over his temper, and caused the death of many men. For this he became an outlaw, which in those days in Iceland meant, that he could be killed on sight.</p>
<p>After many years staying abroad as an outlaw, Grettir decided to return to Iceland. He and his brother Illugi travelled around the country, looking for a place to stay, that was easy to defend from foes. After staying shortly in Skagafjörður, the brothers decided to go to Drangey Island. It was very steep and easy to defend. There were great many birds there, and sheep that farmers kept in the island, so there would be enough food. </p>
<p>They paid the farmer Þorvaldur from Reykir to sail with them to the island, and if they needed to go back to shore, they would send Þorvaldur smoke signals. With them to Drangey came the man Glaumur, who they had met on their travels.</p>
<p>When they reached Drangey, around eighty sheep were stored in the island, owned by various farmers in Skagafjörður. The farmers tried to bargain with them for the return of their livestock, but the outlaws refused. They talked to the farmers from the top of the island, having taken the stairs up, so there was no way for the farmers to get near them.</p>
