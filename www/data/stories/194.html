<p>At this time, the farmers of the region were supposed to restore and build the wall in the graveyard of Barð in Fljótum. One day, early in the morning, all the farmers had arrived but one; that man was considered rather grumpy and generally disliked. Hours passed and the man did not show up and the other felt that he was quite late by now. Around the middle of the day they see where the man is coming and leads a grey horse. When he arrives the others who felt he showed up too late for this cooperation scold him. The man is unaffected by their words and asks where he should start working. He is ordered to help out those who were moving turf and rocks into the graveyard and he obeys. The grey horse was gruff and irritable towards the others horses; he broke loose from the horses, bit some horses and beat them and finally no horse could work any longer because of that grey horse. The men found this quite annoying and decided to load him with a heavier burden, but it didn’t work. Twice as heavy burden as before was still easy form him. He continued his horseplay until all the other horses had ran away and he was the only one that remained. The man then loaded the horse with all the burdens the others had carried and he calmed down. The horse moved all the turf and rocks needed for the wall in the graveyard. When that was done the man takes of his harness, right by the new wall, and then he hits the horse’s loins as soon has he lets him go. The horse did not like this, put up his hind legs and kicked the wall with the results that a huge gap formed in the wall. The gap has remained in this wall despite all efforts to fill it and in the end; it was decided to keep the gap as a pathway from the graveyard to the church. The last that was seen from the horse was when he ran away and didn’t stop until he had reached Lake Hólmsvatn; people realized by then that the horse must have been a nykur. (A nykur in folklore is believed to have been similar to horses, normally grey in colour, with hooves turned backwards and lived in lakes and streams; they were often believed to come up to lure people with them into their lakes.)</p>
