<p>In the first part of this century, a man called Jón Jónsson lived in Skörðugil in Langholt in Skagafjörður. He was unmarried and was his own master, often participated in group travelling to the south coast and under the Glacier, was quit masculine and handsome, no wonder that women fell for him and many stories exist of his dealings with women, not all of them nice. Jón was considered somewhat dangerous and not trustworthy; there was something sinister about him and he didn’t have many friends. But he did though have one old friend, Tómas from Tunguháls in Tungusveit; that farm belongs to the parish of Goðdalir. Jón had a nickname, Skarði or “the breach”, derived from his farm Skörðurgil or Breach-Gully. He was not a rich man but he owned a good pinto horse, still famous in Skagafjörður and called Skarða-Skjóni or Breach-Horsey.</p>
<p>This stanza was composed about Jón and Skjóni:</p>
<blockquote>
He is the mildest of all lions<br/>
Runs around this harsh land<br/>
Skjóni, easily recognizable <br/>
When Jón the breach comes riding.
</blockquote>

<p>When Jón was getting quite old and his health was going downhill, he saddled his horse, still in good shape, and rode to his friend Tómas in Tunguháls. When he departed he gave his friend the horse, told him that he didn’t need it anymore, and asked for some nag for the ride home. Tómas found this request odd, but obeyed his friend and gave him in return an old roan mare. Jón did though give Tómas the horse with the condition that nobody would ride the horse except for Tómas himself – or else the worst would happen. </p>
<p>Tómas gives Jón his word and Jón rides the old mare home. It was in the autumn, it was dark and thawing. In the evening a work-maid in Krossanes – the most remote farm in Vallhólmi – sees Jón ride around the farmyard. They didn’t speak to each other, and when she came inside she mentioned that it was strange that Jón wasn’t riding his own Skjóni.</p>
<p>From that moment nothing was heard of Jón or the old mare, no matter how hard people searched and in the end people believed it most likely that both the man and the mare had drowned in the river Héraðsvötn. </p>
<p>The next spring, the doctor Ari Arason junior was on his way home to Flugumýri, east of Héraðsvötn, but the river was at that time impassable. The ferry was situated in Miðgrund east of the river but is now in Vellir in Hólmur. Sigurður was the name of the ferryman, a farmer in Miðgrund; a tough man and unscrupulous; it was said, amongst other things, that he had taken mittens and socks off of people who couldn’t pay the fee with money. Between Sigurður and Jón the breach there was never any friendship but rather quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Doctor Ari took the ferry and his horses swam across the river, a bit further upstream, because of currents and ice. They managed to get quite straight across the river and on the bank they were saddled as well as Sigurður’s horse. East of the river the sands were wet and sodden; Sigurður and Ari rode along the sand and before too long they saw a body and it was covered in sand. Ari dismounts his horse, wipes the sand of the body’s face and they both realise that it was Jón the breach. Sigurður did not dismount his horse and Ari asks, as a joke, whether he hasn’t heard the folklore that one must close the eyes of people that are found dead outside, or at least adjust them so they rest better. Sigurður denies it stubbornly and claims that bloody Jón the breach deserves to stay where he is now. So, Sigurður and Ari continue their ride from the sands to the grassland, but suddenly Sigurður falls off his horse and is as dead as a doornail. Of course, Jón the breach was blamed for his death and the common opinion was that Jón had punished Sigurður a bit too heavily for his bad mouth. </p>
<p>Somewhat later it happened that the reverend in Goðdalir was supposed to receive Holy Communion from the reverend of Mælifell, and therefore everybody in the parish went to church. Everybody in Tunguháls wished to attend church except for Tómas who was ill and had to stay in bed. There weren’t enough horses for everyone who wanted to go, but Tómas forbade anyone to ride his horse Skjóni. His wife believed it couldn’t be that dangerous to take the horse but Tómas was adamant. But in the end, one of the workers saddled Skjóni for himself. When they left the farmyard, and everybody had said their prayers, the worker put up his hat and all of a sudden he felt as if somebody sat behind him on the horse’s back, the horse felt overburdened and fell dead. This was when he was still in the hayfield. Tómas was not happy when he heard the news, and rumour had it that Jón the breach was to blame. </p>
<p>Jósef Grímsson was a man, an excellent goldsmith, but quite poor and ate horsemeat. He lived in Torfumýri next to Flugumýri, before him a man called Jón lived there, nick-named the shit of Torfumýri. Jósef went to Tunguháls to get the body of the horse but couldn’t use much of it. He could only utilize the head, but the body was otherwise so bruised that it was hardly edible. </p>
<p>The widow of Sigurður from Miðgrund, who was already mentioned, was called Sigríður. A few years later than this was, around 1870, she was found dead and stiff, with a bundle of hay in her arms because she had died in the winter, just when she was giving the sheep some hay; some of it had been eaten when she was found. Some people decided that her death was the fault of Jón the breach.
Thereafter, I didn’t hear any other stories of this Jón.</p>
