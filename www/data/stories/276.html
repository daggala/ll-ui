<p>Þorbjörn öngull made another attempt to talk to Grettir and was accompanied by his foster mother. As before, Grettir had no interest in Þorbjörn’s pleads, offers or threats, and started to throw rocks at him. One rock hit the old woman, and broke her thigh bone. After this, they turned around and sailed to shore.</p>
<p>The old woman was angry and wanted revenge. She went down to the shore and found a big piece of driftwood that had formally been the roots of a great tree. On this she carved magical runes, and recited a spell. </p>
<p>Two days later Grettir and Illugi were gathering driftwood to burn. Illugi saw the driftwood roots and wanted to take it up to the island and burn it. Grettir refused, and said that some evil had sent it. The next day they saw it again, now a lot closer to the stairs leading up to the island. Grettir still would not take it, and rolled it in to the sea. The third day, the wind blew strong, and it rained heavily, so Grettir sent Glaumur to gather driftwood. Just by the stairs Glaumur finds the roots, and carries it up to the island. He tells Grettir that he has found a lot of wood, and that it is his turn to split it. Grettir gets really mad, and throws the axe at the roots. As soon as the axe touches the roots, it falls flat and flies back, and lands in Grettir’s thigh just above the knee. The wound was large and very deep.</p>
<p>Grettir was extremely angry at Glaumur. First he had let the fire die, now he himself was injured because of him. The next time he would mess upp, they surely would not survive it. Grettir‘s wound was blue and swollen, and be barely slept for pains. He was sure that this was the work of the fostermother‘s magic, her revenge for the stone he threw.</p>
<p>Grettir was getting very sick, and the wound got infected. He was getting closer to death by the day. Illugi stayed with him always, so it came to Glaumur to wach the stairs, no matter the weather. One day, when Glaumur walks to the stairs, he gets very sleepy, he could not keep his eyes open, and fell asleep by the stairs. </p>
<p>The very same day, Þorbjörn öngull came to Drangey with a flock of men, on the advice of his foster mother. To their surprise, the stair is in its place when they arrive at the island, their way is clear. A great battle commenced. Illugi fought ruthlessly, he killed three men and fought off many others until he was slain. Grettir managed to kill two of his attackers, before he passed out from the pain in the wound, and was killed. Þorbjörn beheaded Grettir, and took his head to Viðvík to claim the bounty that was on Grettir’s head. Glaumur slept through all this commotion and the attacker took him with them to shore.</p>
<p>Cousins of Illugi and Grettir sailed to Drangey to claim their bodies, and they were buried at Reykir. Grettir’s head however never made it back to the body, and is buried in is childhood home at Bjarg.</p>
