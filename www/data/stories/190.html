<p>Kristín, who lived in Minniþverá around 1830–1840, said that her mother who was psychic had been with Kristín's grandmother working in the field when they saw two women come down from the mountain, between them was a man holding something in his hands; she saw that it was a cradle covered with a red cloth. Then they started beating the man until he started shrinking and turned into a small baby. Then they kneaded him until he looked just like a new-born baby. They laid him in the cradle, tucked him with the red cloth, and carried the cradle between them and headed towards the farm. The girl told her mother what she had seen; her mother reacted swiftly and ran towards the farm. She managed to reach the cradle that she had left outside the farmhouse before the hidden women did. When the hidden women saw that, they took the baby from their cradle and spanked it until it started growing again and turned bit by bit into the man it had originally been. He then headed with them back towards the mountain and they all disappeared. </p>
